## Tweet Thread (Launch Day)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
💸 You're leaving money on the table.

Every token you've ever received on Solana costs ~0.002 SOL in rent.

Most wallets have 10-100+ empty accounts from:
- Failed mints
- Airdrop claims
- Sold tokens

That's 0.02-0.2+ SOL just sitting there.

🧵👇
```

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
```
The problem: Solana has no native way to bulk-close these accounts.

You'd have to:
1. Find each empty account manually
2. Build close transactions one by one
3. Sign them all individually

Until now.
```

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
```
Introducing SweepQuest 🧹

Built natively for @SolanaMobile Seeker:
✅ Instant wallet scan
✅ See all empty accounts + SOL locked
✅ Close in batches (up to 15 per tx)
✅ SOL returned directly to your wallet

No fees. 100% of rent is yours.
```

**Tweet 4 (Social Proof CTA):**
```
Early users are already reclaiming:
- 0.05 SOL from 25 accounts
- 0.12 SOL from 60 accounts
- 0.20+ SOL from airdrop hunters

Check your wallet. You'll be surprised 👀

Download free on dApp Store:

**Tweet 5 (Gamification Hook):**
```
🧹 Earn SWEEP points as you clean!

First 100 accounts = Early Sweeper badge

## User-Generated Content Strategy

### How Twitter Sharing Works (In-App)
After successfully closing accounts, users see a "Share on 𝕏 (+1 SWEEP)" button that:
1. Opens Twitter with pre-filled tweet
2. Awards +1 bonus SWEEP point (one-time)
3. Creates organic social proof

### Default Share Template (Generated by App)
```
🧹 Just swept [X] empty token accounts and reclaimed [Y.YYYY] SOL with @SweepQuestApp!

Stop leaving rent locked in dead tokens. Get yours back 👇
